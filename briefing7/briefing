Amazing!

I knew from the beginning we could count on you! We wouldn't have come this far without you, but not all is over yet. While there is no doubt you created a great product, people simply don't know yet. I got everything set up so we can start manufacturing ASAP and our marketing and sales department are spinning.

It will take a while for us to get the Microhard CPU out into the wild and there is not much to do for you right now.

Why don't you take a vacation and check back in a few months. You deserved it! I will make sure to come up with some new ideas in the meantime.

Looking forward to talk you then,
Will
