Great news for you today!

I know that doing bus versions of finished designs can be tedious and we don't want to waste your mind on monkey work... gladly I was able to hire an intern, who will help you out with that!

Ted is a novice and therefore don't expect him to come up with any original designs, but he will assist you in creating any bus versions similar to ones you already created.

Ted gets the work, you get the fun!
