It's great to see you got the hang of things around here!

The elements you built so far work great, but we need to develop bus versions of those. Designing those should be a trivial task as you can reuse the elements you developed so far... however make sure you understand the bus syntax of the design editor first!

Check the part in the manual on bus syntax.

Keep up the great work,
Will
