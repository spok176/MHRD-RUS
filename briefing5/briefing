The best CPU in the world isn't worth a whole lot, if you can't save the program that drives it or the results it produces.

Something that all the hardware elements you designed so far have in common is the absence of memory. We need to change this. That is why I got a business associate to source some sweet D-Flip-Flops!

When designing sequential elements make sure you consider the timing aspect... check out the chapter on sequential logic in the manual and have a look at the spec sheet for the D-Flip-Flop under the "Completed/" folder.
